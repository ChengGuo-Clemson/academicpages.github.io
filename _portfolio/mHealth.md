**Background**

Health Information Technology (HIT) has grown exponentially in the past decade, allowing such tools such as the health record to transcend the paper format into a more integrated and accessible electronic form. Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have the potential to improve care and reduce costs. However, this transition has not fully embraced its potential in terms of enabling patient privacy— EHRs could more easily allow patients to take ownership of their records, yet most have inherited their predecessors’ dearth of privacy options. This runs contrary to the Office of the National Coordinator for HIT and independent research, both of which have mandated the development of such privacy options.

**Project Purpose**

This project seeks to fulfill the mandate for privacy options by utilizing previously existent research as the framework for a mobile EHR sharing tool. Enabling users to share their health information in the context of the medical encounter, our application grants patients the ability to control what information is shared with each respective provider. This level of control may assuage patients’ privacy concerns, which can in turn reduce the strength and frequency of negative privacy maintenance behaviors. These behaviors, such as lying to providers or avoiding care, directly damage health outcomes. Negating the circumstances for such actions negates the harm, improving overall health outcomes.

**Design Method**

To design a mobile application that enables the privacy options patients require, our team employed an iterative process beginning with a literature review and development of specific solutions. This was followed by multiple conceptualizations and an initial prototype concept. This concept began a five-stage iterative design process, including four cycles of user testing. User testing employed a think-aloud protocol, and was combined with continuous informal heuristically analysis by our design team. Combined, these methods informed the structured design and development process.

**Final Design**

Our design process resulted in Hermes, a mobile application concept that allows users to select a provider and choose which health information can be accessed by that provider. These privacy options have been informed by patients’ own preferences and the design has been informed by 24 participants in multiple iterative cycles. The application is intuitive and simple to use, allowing sharing settings to be created in moments with little information required from the user. Hermes promises to not only enhance privacy, but also to ease the overall EHR transfer process from both the patient and provider perspectives.

**Design process**

***Initial mock-ups***

The first, conceptual phase of development involved the creation of multiple paper prototypes. Creating such prototypes assisted the designers in conceptualizing the workflow and functionality of the primary elements. Outside of conceptualizing a standard template for navigation, we did not use wireframes or other graphic tools in this stage, concerned that such tools may engender a focus on layout and restrict originality.
