I presendted this study at [PervasiveHealth'14](http://pervasivehealth.org/2014/show/home). See the [paper](http://chengguo.info/pervasivehealth'14.pdf) and the [slides](http://chengguo.info/PervasiveHealth'14_slides.pdf) of my talk.

Searching for health information online is becoming increasingly
common. The variety of peer reports and facts available online is
also increasing. Yet little is known about how users come to trust
the material they encounter. Our paper explores the impact of
individual differences on trust in the context of information
seeking behavior. Twenty-six people participated in an online
study, which included a survey and a search. We developed two
scales to measure trust in websites and trust in forums. We found
that experience with chronic disease was related to increased trust
in forums, while trust in websites stayed constant. We draw
implications from our results and relate them to the literature on
trust.
