Personal smartphones are in the hands of over 90% of
American adults, and are at high risk for security threat.
Although passwords and pins are commonly used to
alleviate these threats, they are easily hacked and still leave
the user vulnerable. This study aims to explore video chat
as an alternative form of authentication using the users
existing social network, and whether their mood or location
had an effect on whether they were willing to use video
chat to authenticate.
